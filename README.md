# ECE-366-G9-Proj3
Project 3 for ECE 366, group 9 repo

Requirements: 

for the language:
-8bit instructions and 8bit data
-we can create whatever instructions we want/need for running our PRPG
-come up with encoding scheme
-decide on register usage
-have memory (load/store)
-for a single cycle CPU

for the hardware design:
-internal ALU diagram showing how instructions get implemented
-CPU diagram supporting the single cycle instructions


To turn in:

-instruction table showing controls for single cyle
-CPU diagram
-ALU diagram
-machine code source file for PRPG
-python source code for simulator
-report
